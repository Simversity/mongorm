{"name":"Mongorm","tagline":"Mongo based ORM","body":"#### Introduction\r\n\r\nNoSQL databases like MongoDB are a hot tool these days. The ease of usage and the speed of development make them the right choice of tool for most of application use cases. The fact that you can dump any JSON (read BSON) data to databases is the real advantage over tight physical schemas. But the lack of data integrity and validations could mean that all the validations and datatype checks have to re-implemented at the application layer.\r\n\r\nMongorm is a lightweight ORM available to perform basic data type checks and constraint validations. It can be imported to create a base class used to define models that represent a collection in the database. ORM also provides a bunch of default datatypes that can be used alongside any custom datatypes that you may want to provde.\r\n\r\nWorking on this... hold tight.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
